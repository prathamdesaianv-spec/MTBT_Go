C) Recovery of tick by tick data  
 
Tick by tick data is available for recovery on TCP. At the Exchange end the recovery requests are managed and 
serviced through a setup consisting of a load balancer server and multiple recovery servers. If the client end 
application misses any tick data, i t can recover the missed ticks by sending request on TCP to the server IP 
provided by the Exchange (segment wise IPs and ports provided below). The response messages will be 
provided on TCP. The TCP connections for recovering messages are not persistent.  
 
A new connection has to be made for each and every  recovery request. The recovery requests are served from 
file stored in recovery server. Due to this factor, there is a lag / delay in the tick data from recovery servers, as 
compared to direct multicast feed.

Important usage guidelines for connecting to Order Book  Snapshot  recovery:  
 
Members  are suggested to use snapshot recovery whenever they have lost large number of ticks on multicast 
or they have joined the MTBT feed very late. This will reduce the time to recover all the missed ticks through 
recovery and build the order book up to the la test point.  
 
At the Exchange end the snapshot recovery is disseminated through Solace Application / Hardware. The 
snapshot recovery needs to be requested by client applications through Solace API. After receiving the 
snapshot message, the client applications are suppos ed to disconnect. It is possible that the client 
applications can get disconnected during recovery of snapshot message, due to snapshot message being 
refreshed at the Exchange end. In such cases client applications can again try to recover the snapshot 
mes sage.  
 
Members are expected to use 7. 32.0.3 version  of SOLACE API which can be downloaded from 
https://solace.com/downloads/  for best experience.  
General Notes applicable for all types of market data broadcast:  
 
• The size of broadcast indicated above is an estimated approximation and shall change depending upon 
the market activity. Thus, Market participants are strongly advised to monitor and adequately size their 
infrastructure and systems while subscribing to the se feeds.  9 lvq.nse.fo.od.9.orderbook

NSE/MEM/26958  dated June 19, 2 014. Exchange data can be used by Member’s clients who are 
registered for trading with the member on the Exchange in any segment.  
• Members shall be solely responsible for implementing and maintaining redundancy for market data 
broadcast subscribed from NSEIL. NSEIL shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever including 
but not limited to for any disconnection, excess bandwidth ut ilization, related latency issues’ etc. which 
arises out of the member’s decisions on market data broadcast configurations . 
• National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSEIL”) strongly recommends its member to build resilience 
and redundancy in their subscription to market data broadcast provided by NSEIL, to ensure continuity 
of their business operations. NSEIL has made enablin g provisions for members to implement 
redundancies by providing two sources of data and/or data recovery mechanisms. Members shall be 
solely responsible for implementing and maintaining redundancy for market data broadcast subscribed 
from NSEIL. NSEIL shal l not be held liable in any manner whatsoever including but not limited to for any 
disconnection, excess bandwidth utilization, related latency issues’ etc. which arises out of the 
member’s decisions on market data broadcast configurations.  
 
 
Annexure 3 
 
Members are requested to take note of below advisory and guidance regarding market data broadcast 
parameters:  
A. Advisory for members subscribing to Price volume (5 depth 1 second refresh), other related data, 
master updates, market open/close status message broadcast etc.  
• NSEIL has made enabling provisions for members to implement redundancies by providing tw o sources 
of data broadcast parameters namely Source 1 and source 2.  
• Exchange has provided option for Members to add the broadcast configuration for both sources in the 
Exchange provided UDP application for windows as well as linux OS.  
• Member can configure the sources 1 & 2 in active – active manner / active – passive manner as per their 
business requirement.   
o Exchange broadcasts the market data on both the sources/channels simultaneously. Members 
are required to select one of the option  
▪ Option1 - active -active manner i.e. both the sources/channels are configured at 
member’s end and market data is received by members on both the sources/channels 
OR  
▪ Option2 - active -passive manner i.e. both the sources/channels are configured at 
member’s end but market data is received by members on the source which is activated 
by member.  
o The Exchange has multiple backup systems and processes besides having various checks and 
balances to ensure proper functioning of the trading systems. However, the possibility of an 
event where Exchange is not able to broadcast the market data on one of th e source/channel 
cannot be ruled out. Hence, the above action will help members to quickly shift the source at

their end and mitigate the risk of business disruption in case one of the source/channel goes 
down.  
o It is strongly recommended that the members build resiliency in their implementation by 
choosing any of the above -mentioned options. Members shall be solely responsible for 
implementing and maintaining redundancy for market data broadcast subscribed from t he 
Exchange and Exchange will not be liable for any business disruption at member’s end arising 
due to no action by members.  
• For members using Exchange provided UDP application, option is available to members to start / stop 
the broadcast for all / respective streams as per their convenience in the UDP application keeping in 
mind the bandwidth requirements of the broadcast strea ms.  
• Manuals for UDP application for Windows as well as Linux are available on Extranet  for reference.  
 
B. Advisory for members subscribing to Multicast Tick By Tick Feeds (MTBT)  
• The Tick Data broadcast feed provided by the Exchange is available on two separate Multicast Channels 
(Source 1 and Source 2) for each Stream on active -active basis. On one multicast channel the feed is 
delayed and lagging behind the other feed.  Please refer the captioned circular s for details regarding 
the Source 1 and Source 2 multicast IP and port s. 
• Kindly note that the MTBT data broadcast being on UDP, there can be occasional drops in the 
broadcasts provided by the Exchange due to the same.  It is an expected behaviour.  
• It is recommended that the end user application should subscribe to both multicast channels for each 
stream and receives the data from both the channels in active -active manner. This needs to be done 
to ensure that data loss is minimized for the receiving applications as there is a possibility of data loss 
in multicast protocol.  
• If the end user application misses any tick data from both the active -active channels it can recover the 
ticks by sending recovery requests to recovery server on TCP. The recovery requests are served from 
file stored in recovery server. Due to this factor,  there is a lag / delay in the tick data from recovery 
servers, as compared to direct multicast feed.  
• Members are requested to refer the API’s for MTBT, wherein we have provided the tuning parameter 
for receiving MTBT as well as guidelines for recovery.  
• Exchange also provides facility for snapshot recovery. Members are suggested to use snapshot 
recovery whenever they have lost large number of ticks on multicast or they have joined the MTBT feed 
very late. This will reduce the time to recover all the missed ticks through recovery and build the order 
book up to  the latest point.  
• API for MTBT can be accessed from NSE website under the following link:
